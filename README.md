Just my repository
Hello, My name is Connor. I am a Military weapons and vehicles fanatic, and I currently homeschool. I love previous world history and wars, and know lots of tactical knowledge. I also love chemistry and have a home assembly line for thermite. I live on a farm in Texas and I have just recently graduated. I work at our local home-town Vet clinic and get to help assist surgeries, take care of pets/animals, and use advanced equipment to assist on farm-calls. I was in state championships for Skeet-shooting and I placed #8 after our team one the tournaments. My hobbies are gaming, riding my motorcycle, and shooting sports. I am a southern babtist and I know Jesus died for my sins, so i can enjoy everlasting life, and prosper in all the blessing He has given to me. I am learning Harvards CS50 coding course to get a greater understanding of computers, as my only expierience was a python coding class in minecraft, from 2016 XD. Really exited to be learning about this, and ive learned this course can open up so many new oppertunities to expand my carreer options, aswell as gain a greater reputation.
